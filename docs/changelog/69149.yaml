  title: Remove support for `JAVA_HOME`
  area: Packaging
  details: |-
    {es} no longer supports the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable. Note
    that {es} does not treat `JAVA_HOME` being set as a failure, as it is
    perfectly reasonable to have this configured at a system level.
  impact: |-
    If you rely on the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to configure the
    JDK for {es}, you now need to use the `ES_JAVA_HOME` environment
    variable instead.
